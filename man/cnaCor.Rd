\title{Cell - Tumour CNA Correlations}
\usage{
cnaCor(
  cna,
  cor.method = "pearson",
  threshold = NULL,
  bySample = F,
  samples = NULL,
  max.nchar = NULL,
  sep = "-|_",
  excludeFromAvg = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cna}{a matrix of gene rows by cell columns containing CNA values.}

\item{cor.method}{character string indicating the method to use for the pairwise correlations. E.g. 'pearson', 'spearman'. Default: 'pearson'}

\item{samples}{a character vector of sample names list of character vectors (cell/column names). Can be provided if the cna matrix contains multiple samples of cells, i.e. multiple tumours, such that the cell-group correlations are calcualted for each group/tumour in turn. Default: FALSE}

\item{max.nchar}{number of first characters to be subselected as sample name.}

\item{sep}{if bySample is TRUE and samples are NULL, split cell IDs by <sep> and take the first substring to be the sample name. Default: '-|_'}
}
\value{
a numeric vector or list of numeric vectors
}
\description{
Compute the pairwise correlations between individual cells' CNA values and the average CNA values in their tumour of origin.
